# Requirements and Installation

Opqua runs on Python. A good place to get the latest version it if you don't
have it is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

Opqua is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opqua/) to install
through `pip`, as explained below.

If you haven't yet, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):
```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

Install Opqua by running

```bash
pip install opqua
```

The pip installer should take care of installing the necessary packages.
However, for reference, the versions of the packages used for opqua's
development are saved in `requirements.txt`

Check out the `changelog` file for information on recent updates.
