# Usage

To run any Opqua model (including the tutorials in the `examples/tutorials`
folder), save the model as a `.py` file and execute from the console using
`python my_model.py`.

You may also run the models from a notebook environment
such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or an integrated development environment
(IDE) such as [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), both available through
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

## Minimal example

The simplest model you can make using Opqua looks like this:

```python
# This simulates a pathogen with genome "AAAAAAAAAA" spreading in a single
# population of 100 hosts, 20 of which are initially infected, under example
# preset conditions for host-host transmission.

from opqua.model import Model

my_model = Model()
my_model.newSetup('my_setup', preset='host-host')
my_model.newPopulation('my_population', 'my_setup', num_hosts=100)
my_model.addPathogensToHosts( 'my_population',{'AAAAAAAAAA':20} )
my_model.run(0,100)
data = my_model.saveToDataFrame('my_model.csv')
graph = my_model.compartmentPlot('my_model.png', data)
```

For more example usage, have a look at the `examples` folder. For an overview
of how Opqua models work, check out the Materials and Methods section on the
manuscript
[here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo0173). A
summarized description is shown below in the
**How Does Opqua Work?** section.
For more information on the details of each function, head over to the
**Documentation** section.

## Example Plots

These are some of the plots Opqua is able to produce, but you can output the
raw simulation data yourself to make your own analyses and plots. These are all
taken from the examples in the `examples/tutorials` folderâ€”try them out
yourself! See the

### Population genetic composition plots for pathogens
An optimal pathogen genome arises and outcompetes all others through intra-host
competition. See `fitness_function_mutation_example.py` in the
`examples/tutorials/evolution` folder.

### Host/vector compartment plots
A population with natural birth and death dynamics shows the effects of a
pathogen. "Dead" denotes deaths caused by pathogen infection. See
`vector-borne_birth-death_example.py` in the `examples/tutorials/vital_dynamics`
folder.

### Plots of a host/vector compartment across different populations in a metapopulation
Pathogens spread through a network of interconnected populations of hosts. Lines
denote infected pathogens. See
`metapopulations_migration_example.py` in the
`examples/tutorials/metapopulations` folder.
![Compartments](../img/metapopulations_migration_example.png "metapopulations_migration_example populations")

### Host/vector compartment plots
A population undergoes different interventions, including changes in
epidemiological parameters and vaccination. "Recovered" denotes immunized,
uninfected hosts.
See `intervention_examples.py` in the `examples/tutorials/interventions` folder.

### Pathogen phylogenies
Phylogenies can be computed for pathogen genomes that emerge throughout the
simulation. See `fitness_function_mutation_example.py` in the
`examples/tutorials/evolution` folder.
